## Turning the tragedy into a gift: The role of parental perceptions of their child's overexcitability in promoting self-esteem, hope and well-being among children

### Abstract

Children with overexcitability (OE) have higher than average responsiveness to experience of inner and external stimulus. OE was described as a "tragic gift" (Dabrowski, 1972), since it could increase ones' potential for development, while enhancing psychological difficulties. Therefore, we expected higher level of OE to be found among gifted children compared to non-gifted. Moreover, we expected that parental acceptance of their child's OE will mediate the relationships between the level of OE and the child's coping resources of self-esteem, hope and well-being. The hypotheses were confirmed among sample of 107 parent-child (aged 8-14 years) pairs. The results revealed that goodness of fit between parents' perceptions of actual and expected level of their child's OE, is strongly related to the child's coping resources, and also mediated the relationships between level of OE and the coping resources. Based on the results, guidelines for an intervention program were suggested.
